# Title
Global Water Sources v Spending

# Sustainable Development Goal(s)
Responsible consumption & production
Clean water & sanitation

# Features
* Ability to compare how a country obrains its water resources v. how they spend those resources (interactable visual graph)
* Interactable Global Map w/ data
* Small dictionary (not the coding kind, the kind where you ask about the meanings of terms)

## Feature 1: Interactable Global Map

* Person responsible: Lloyd
* User story: I click on Canada and view that as of the most recent data, Canada's agricultural water withdrawal as % of total renewable water resources was 0.13298%
* Acceptance Criteria: A feature where the user can go and click on a country on an interactable map and it will provide the most up-to-date data for the counry's water data (agricultural withdrawal, indusrial use efficiency, irrigation use efficiency, service use efficiency, overall water use efficiency, produced desalinated water, direct usage of agricultural drainage, direct use of treated municipal water, usage of fresh groundwater, usage of fresh surface water)

## Feature 2: Interactable Visual Graphss

* Person responsible: Paul
* User story: I want to compare the total drinking water consumption with the freshwater reserve in California in 2020. 
* Acceptance Criteria: A functional feature where the user can compare the type of water consumption to water source. The user can change the time and location. The comparisons will be displayed through visual graphs/charts.  

## Feature 3: Small Dictionary of Terminology
* Person responsible: Jay
* User story: Click on the term "groundwater" and it tells you "Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth's surface in rock and soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations" (taken from wikipedia, i assume wed write our own definitions)
* Acceptance Criteria: A feature where you click on a specific term that is used in this project (such as "industrial usage", "agricultural usage", "surface water", "ground water", etc.) and gives you it's cooresponding definition
